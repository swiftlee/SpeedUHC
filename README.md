# SpeedUHC
An older minigame written by myself and iPyronic (found on the Spigot forums). 

INTRO: This minigame was intended for a minigame-type server, and was not held under a NDA. 
It has been repurposed for the application to the Mineplex minigame server.

The minigame was created for use with 1.8 Minecraft and Spigot versions.
No pom.xml is included because the project did not use Maven at the time, but conversion is simple.

This minigame has MySQL support, and directly hooks into the GameLeaderboards plugin and the
BungeeSigns plugin, which will be released on separate GitHub Repositories.
